Women’s Safety + Commute Buddy App – Project Description

Overview
A free Android app designed for women’s safety and secure commuting. The app provides real-time location tracking, geofencing, SOS alerts, shake detection for emergencies, and commute buddy features. Built with Firebase backend + OpenStreetMap (free) for maps, ensuring no heavy costs for an individual developer.

Features

1. User Authentication (Firebase Auth)
- Signup/Login with Email/Phone/Google.
- Secure storage of user details.

2. Trusted Contacts (Firebase Database)
- Users can add family/friends as emergency contacts.
- Contacts stored securely in Firebase Realtime Database/Firestore.

3. Live Location Sharing (OpenStreetMap + Firebase)
- User’s live location shared with trusted contacts.
- OpenStreetMap (OSMDroid/Mapbox SDK) used instead of Google Maps (completely free).

4. Geofencing (Safe Zones + Alerts)
- Define Safe Zones (home, office, college).
- If the user leaves a safe zone at odd hours -> send alert to contacts.
- Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) used for push notifications.

5. SOS Trigger (Shake to Alert)
- When the phone is shaken strongly, the app will:
  - Start audio recording automatically (store in Firebase or locally).
  - Send an emergency SMS with live location to trusted contacts.
  - Optionally call the primary emergency contact.

6. Commute Buddy Feature
- Users can find trusted commute partners (friends, colleagues, classmates).
- Option to share route and ETA securely.

7. Emergency Services Integration
- Direct button to call police helpline (100 / 112 in India).
- Option to send location to nearest NGO/volunteer group (future expansion).

Tech Stack
- Frontend (Android): Kotlin + Jetpack Compose
- Backend: Firebase (Auth, Firestore/Realtime Database, Cloud Messaging, Storage)
- Maps & Location: OpenStreetMap (OSMDroid SDK) -> free alternative to Google Maps
- Geofencing: Android Location Services + Firebase for triggers
- SOS Messaging: SMS Manager API + Firebase Cloud Messaging
- Audio Recording: MediaRecorder API (triggered on shake)

Flow
1. User logs in -> adds emergency contacts.
2. Location runs in background -> updates Firebase.
3. If user exits geofence -> notify trusted contacts.
4. If phone is shaken -> auto-record audio + send SMS with live location.
5. Trusted contacts can open the map link to see live tracking.
6. Commute Buddy feature lets users share route with a friend.

Free APIs / Services Used
- Firebase (Free tier – 50K reads/writes per day, enough for small apps).
- OpenStreetMap (OSMDroid SDK) -> 100% free, no payment required.
- Android SMS Manager API -> free, sends SMS via user’s SIM.
- Android MediaRecorder API -> built-in, no extra cost.
- Android Location Services (Geofencing API) -> built-in.
